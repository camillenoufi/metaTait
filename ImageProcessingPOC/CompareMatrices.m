function [ boolMatch ] = CompareMatrices( reconstructed_image_matrix, downsampled_image_matrix )
%CompareMatrices takes in 2 3D matrices and compares their content
%
% Inputs: reconstructed_image_matrix: a matrix produced from a data packet
%          downsampled_image_matrix: a matrix produced by downsampling a standard image 
% Output: boolMatch:  a boolean value (1 or 0) that indicates if (1) the
%                     matrices are identical or (0) if they are not
